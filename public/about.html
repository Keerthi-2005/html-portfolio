<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Keerthana Balakrishnan. I am from Tamil Nadu, a state in India. I have just completed 
  12th grade. I have applied for some colleges and am waiting for the results.

<p>I like code. While waiting for my results, I have taken up this Web Development course in Udemy.
  I am loving every second of it. I want to go into the field of computer science.

<p>My other interests lie in the field of drawing and painting. I also love to read books of any kind.
  I also like to cook and play sports, mainly basketball and badminton. I wish to travel to other places,
  to discover their history and culture.
